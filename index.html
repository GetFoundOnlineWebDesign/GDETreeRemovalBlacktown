    <h1>Tree Removal Blacktown</h1>
    <p>
      From larger residential blocks to busy commercial and industrial sites, our tree crews work across Blacktown and
      Greater Western Sydney carrying out safe removals, canopy lifts and ongoing tree maintenance.

      <h2>Why Blacktown property owners choose GDE Tree Services Sydney</h2>
      <p>
        Blacktown homes and businesses are often surrounded by tall eucalypts, palms and established trees close to
        sheds, fences and driveways. Our team combines experienced climbers, EWP (elevated work platform) operators
        and modern machinery to manage these trees safely and efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can lift and thin the canopy to improve light and airflow, remove problem limbs over roofs and sheds, and
        tidy up palms that constantly drop fronds and seed pods. For larger jobs, our crews use loaders and
        high-capacity wood chippers to process heavy timber quickly and keep the site as clear as possible.

      <h2>How we manage larger and high-traffic sites</h2>
      <p>

      </p>
      <ul class="service-list">
        <li>Assesses tree condition, access, overhead services and nearby structures before work begins</li>
        <li>Uses EWPs, cranes or professional climbing and rigging techniques where appropriate</li>

        <li>Chips branches and processes large timber using high-capacity wood chippers</li>
        <li>Removes green waste or leaves timber neatly stacked on-site, depending on your preference</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We focus on minimising disruption to your household, tenants, customers or staff, while completing the job to a
        high standard.
